# cxpak — Claude Code Plugin

Structured codebase context for Claude Code, powered by [cxpak](https://github.com/lyubomir-bozhinov/cxpak).

## What It Does

- **Auto-context:** Claude automatically runs `cxpak overview` when you ask about codebase structure
- **Auto-diff:** Claude automatically runs `cxpak diff` when you ask to review changes
- **On-demand commands:** `/cxpak:overview`, `/cxpak:trace`, `/cxpak:diff`, `/cxpak:clean`
